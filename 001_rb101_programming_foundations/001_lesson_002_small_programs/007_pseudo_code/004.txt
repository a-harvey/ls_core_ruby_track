A method that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character in a string; if the given character does not occur at least 3 times, return nil: casual pseudo-code

Given a string.
Given a character.

Create a variable for the number of occurrences and set it equal to 3.
Create a given-variable occurrence counter and set it equal to zero.

Iterate through the string.
  - if the element in the string matches the given character, add 1 to the    
    given-variable occurrence counter.
    - if the given-variable counter is equal to 3, return the index.
  - but if the element in the string doesn't match the given character, move on 
    to the next iteration.

Return nil.

A method that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character in a string; if the given character does not occur at least 3 times, return nil: formal pseudo-code

START

# Given a string called "given_str"
# Given a character called "given_char"

SET occur = 0

LOOP DO... END invoke String#given_char on given_str, and to this evaluated result chain a method call to Enumerator#with_index, passing in the String element as "char" and its index as "idx" for the arguments
  IF char == given_char
    occur = occur + 1
    IF occur == 3
      PRINT idx
  ELSE
    go to the next iteration

PRINT nil
