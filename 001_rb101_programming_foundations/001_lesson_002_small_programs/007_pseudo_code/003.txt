A method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element from the original array, starting with the first element: casual pseudo-code

Given an array of integers.

Create a new, empty array.
Create a counter and set it equal to zero.

Iterate through the array of integers.
  - increase the counter's value by 1.
  - if the counter is an odd number, push the element's value to the new array.
  - but if the counter is an even number, move on to the next iteration.

Once the array of integers has been iterated through, return the new array.

START

# Given an array of integers called "int_arr"

SET new_arr = empty array
SET iterator = 0

LOOP DO...END invoke Array#each on int_arr
  iterator = iterator + 1
  IF iterator == odd
    invoke Array#push on new_arr and pass in the current element as the argument
  ELSE
    go to the next iteration

PRINT new_arr
